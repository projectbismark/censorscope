Writing an experiment with Censorscope
======================================

1) Create a new experiment in experiments/
   $ cd experiments/
   $ touch epic_experiment.lua

2) Start writing code
   $ emacs epic_experiment.lua

3) Add the experiment metadata to config.lua
   - Add a new entry to the `experiments` table

   - This new entry should have the same name as your experiment file
     without the ".lua" extension. (epic_experiment)

   - ["input"] is the input file name for your experiment (usually
     stored in inputs/)
     
   - ["output"] is the output file name for your experiment (usually
     stored in results/)

   - Example -
     $ emacs config.lua
     # Add the following:
     experiments["epic_experiment"] = {
       ["input"] = "epic_experiment.txt",
       ["output"] = "epic_experiment.txt",
     }
       
4) Create input file for your experiment in inputs/
   $ cd inputs/
   $ touch epic_experiment.txt
   
5) Run censorscope and check results/ for the output
   $ cd results/
   $ cat epic_experiment.txt
