/* Initialize an experiments schedule.

 * Arguments:
 * - schedules is the structure to initialize.
 * - base is a libevent2 event base, with which we will schedule our
 *   experiments.
 * - L is a Lua state. The stack must contain a table of censorscope settings at
 *   table_index position. This usually comes from sandbox/main.lua.
 * - table_index the stack position of censorscope settings. It can be either a
 *   relative or absolute index.
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on failure.
