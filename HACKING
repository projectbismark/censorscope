Hacking on Censorscope

Style Guide
-----------
* Read http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaStyleGuide
* Use underscores to separate multiple words (http_request)
* Use lowercase
* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Do not use tabs(\t) for indentation (set up your editor to
  automagically convert tabs to spaces. If your editor can not do
  that, it's time to start using emacs.)
* Don't use the block comment format ([[-- this is crap --]]), just
  use "--"

Commit messages
---------------
* Properly format git commit messages -
  http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html#Commit-Guidelines
* Break large changes into smaller commits
* Make commits as self contained as possible -- if you're moving
  around code and changing logic, break it into smaller commits
